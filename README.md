# PDAC Surfaceome Mapping

**Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)** is one of the most lethal and heterogeneous cancers, with limited therapeutic options and few reliable biomarkers. This project explores the **surfaceome** proteins on the cell surface as a potential source of clinically relevant diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic targets.

```

## Objective

To systematically map surface protein expression across PDAC tumors using TCGA data, stratify tumor subtypes, and identify candidate surface biomarkers linked to clinical outcomes.

```

## Data Sources

- **Transcriptomic & clinical data**: TCGA-PAAD (via GDC or UCSC Xena)
- **Surfaceome gene sets**: Curated from literature and surface protein databases

## Methods

- Preprocessing of RNA-seq and clinical metadata
- Filtering for known surface proteins
- Signatures (IO and TME) analysis
- Association with time-to-event outcomes (OS and PFI)
- Tumor clustering based on surfaceome profiles
- Visualization and biomarker prioritization

```

## 📦 Environment Setup

This project uses [**Pixi**](https://prefix.dev/docs/pixi/) for reproducible environment and dependency management.

### Requirements

- [Pixi](https://prefix.dev/docs/pixi/getting-started/installation/)
- Git

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdac-surfaceome.git
cd pdac-surfaceome

# Create and activate the environment
pixi install
pixi run R         # Start an R session inside the environment
